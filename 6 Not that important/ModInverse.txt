The modular inverse can be obtained using Fermat's little theorem: if a is not congruent to 0 mod p (p is prime), then a^(p-2) is the modular inverse of a modulo p.

For example:
a * a^(p-2) ≡ 1 (mod p)

Therefore compute a^(p-2) mod p as the modular inverse of a.

When applied to division, if
a / b ≡ x (mod p)
this is equivalent to
x ≡ a * b^{-1} (mod p)
where b^{-1} is the modular inverse of b and can be computed as b^(p-2) mod p.
